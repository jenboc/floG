This is my submission for the 2023 GMTK Game Jam, the theme was: "Roles Reversed". This was done completely solo, so it is all my own work, apart from some of the art, sounds and fonts (see below).

I decided to take on the theme with a golf game. In this game, you play as the golf hole trying to avoid golf balls that are trying to roll into you. 

This is my first full project using Unity, and I learnt a ton (above all that I'm definitely not an artist) even if I am slightly disappointed with the result.
